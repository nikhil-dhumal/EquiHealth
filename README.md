# EquiHealth  

**EquiHealth** is a web-based platform (currently under development) that will highlight healthcare inequalities across districts and provide a structured system where citizens can report hospital issues and government officials can address them.  

---

## 🌍 Project Vision  

Access to healthcare is often unequal, with some districts having fewer facilities compared to their population size. EquiHealth aims to:  

- **Collect** healthcare facility and population datasets from official/public sources  
- **Analyze and visualize** inequalities using interactive dashboards and maps  
- **Enable reporting** of hospital shortages and service-related issues by citizens  
- **Provide a resolution system** for government officials to review and act on complaints  

---

## 🚀 Planned Features  

- **Automated Data Collection (Scraping)** – Extract healthcare and population data from reliable online sources  
- **Visualization Dashboards** – Interactive charts and maps to compare healthcare facilities vs. population demand  
- **Complaint Portal** – Simple web interface where citizens can log issues such as shortages, lack of staff, or equipment failures  
- **Government Forum** – Dedicated dashboard for authorities to track, discuss, and resolve reported issues
